CI/CD:continuous integration & continue development

All the software we use: website or app, or any operating system - they are in a continuous state of change. We need to
continuously develop & update these software, so that the customers can use the latest features. Jenkins will help us
to automate this process:
1.  Once the software is ready & looks good on the developer's machine,
    dev pushes that code to the development server. He verifies the changes
    & runs a few test cases to make sure all works fine.
2.  Once everything looks good QAs will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need to get approvals
    from Team Leads or managers.
3.  Once everything looks good & QA gets approval from head or team, write email again to deploy all the changes to
    staging te server.
4.  Once all looks good on staging do the same for the production.
